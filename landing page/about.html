          <h1>Company</h1>
          <p>TransAd seeks to revolutionize the mobile advertising experience by focusing on what users truly want from the experience. Most users view ads as a necessary evil to allow for free applications and content, but do not find any true value in them. This means that advertisers generate leads at an inefficient rate and publishers lose clients due to poor ad performance. TransAd creates a system that is more fruitful for all stakeholders.</p>

          <h1>Purpose</h1>
          <p>We believe that the mobile advertising experience could be actually useful for end-users. We exist to simplify and better integrate mobile ads into the end user experience, making advertising more valuable for publishers.</p>

          <h1>Product</h1>
          <p>TransAd is built with a robust ad exchange that manages ad delivery and an easy-to-use interface for publishers and brands to manage campaigns. TransAd’s strength lies in its proprietary ad format that enables end-user interaction making ads transactional at the point of delivery.</p>
